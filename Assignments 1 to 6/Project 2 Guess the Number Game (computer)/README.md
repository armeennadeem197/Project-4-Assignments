 🔢 Number Guessing Game - Computer vs Human

## 🌟 Features

- 🎮 Reverse number guessing: The computer tries to guess your secret number.
- 📊 Tracks the number of attempts the computer takes.
- 🧠 Smart guessing algorithm: The computer adjusts its guesses based on your feedback.
- 🕵️‍♂️ Basic "cheating" detection: Hints if your feedback seems inconsistent.
- 🎨 Colorful and interactive console interface with emojis.
- 🔄 Option to play multiple rounds.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Think of a secret number** between 1 and 10. Keep it to yourself!
2. The computer will make a **guess**.
3. For each guess, you need to provide feedback by typing one of the following and pressing Enter:
   - **`h`**: If the computer's guess is **too high**.
   - **`l`**: If the computer's guess is **too low**.
   - **`c`**: If the computer's guess is **correct**.
4. Watch as the computer intelligently narrows down the possibilities based on your input.
5. The game ends when the computer correctly guesses your number, and it will display the number of attempts it took.
6. You'll then be asked if you want to play again.

## 📋 Example Gameplay

=============== 🤖 NUMBER GUESSING GAME - COMPUTER VS HUMAN 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 ===============

Think of a secret number between 1 and 10.
I'll try to guess it with your help!

🔮 My guess #1: 4
Is this too (H)igh, too (L)ow, or (C)orrect? l
Okay, I'll guess higher next time! ⬆️

🔮 My guess #2: 7
Is this too (H)igh, too (L)ow, or (C)orrect? h
Okay, I'll guess lower next time! ⬇️

🔮 My guess #3: 6
Is this too (H)igh, too (L)ow, or (C)orrect? c

🎉 Hooray! I guessed your number 6 in 3 attempts!
My guesses: 4 → 7 → 6

Want to play again? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing! Goodbye! 👋

## ⚙️ How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. Save the Python code (provided earlier) as a `.py` file (e.g., `guessing_game.py`).
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
5. Run the game by executing the command: `python guessing_game.py`
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to play!

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

This simple game demonstrates several fundamental programming concepts, including:

- **🔄 Looping (`while` loop):** For the computer to keep guessing until it's correct.
- **🚦 Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** To handle user input and adjust the guessing range.
- **💬 User input (`input()`):** To get feedback from the player.
- **🎲 Random number generation (`random.randint()`):** For the computer to make initial guesses.
- **🧠 Basic algorithmic thinking:** Implementing a simple search strategy (similar to binary search in principle).
- **📊 Data storage (lists):** To keep track of the computer's guess history.

Enjoy playing! 😊
