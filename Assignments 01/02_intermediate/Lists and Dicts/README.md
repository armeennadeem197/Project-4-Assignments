📌 Lists and Dictionaries - Index Game 🎮
This Python script provides an interactive way to understand lists and indexing by allowing users to access, modify, and slice elements from a list.

🔹 How the Program Works:
1️⃣ Predefined List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is used for demonstration.
2️⃣ User chooses an operation:

Access: Retrieve an element by its index.
Modify: Change a value at a given index.
Slice: Extract a portion of the list.
Exit: Quit the game.
3️⃣ Validates user input to prevent errors (e.g., out-of-range indices, invalid input types).
4️⃣ Displays updated list after modifications.
🛠 Key Features & Concepts Used:
✅ Try-Except Handling – Prevents program crashes from invalid input.
✅ Index Validation – Ensures index values are within range.
✅ String Methods & User Interaction – Guides users with clear prompts.
✅ List Slicing & Modification – Demonstrates Python list operations dynamically.

🎯 Example Usage:
📌 User Input & Output:

Current list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Choose an operation: access, modify, slice, exit
Enter operation: access
Enter index to access: 2
Result: 3
Enter operation: modify
Enter index to modify: 1
Enter new value: 99
Updated List: [1, 99, 3, 4, 5]
🚀 Perfect for beginners to explore Python lists interactively! 🏆
