🌍 Intro to Python - Planetary Weight Calculator 🚀

This Python script helps users calculate their weight on different planets based on Earth's gravity. It introduces dictionaries, functions, conditionals, and user input handling in Python.

🔹 How the Program Works:
1️⃣ The program stores gravity factors for various planets in a dictionary. 2️⃣ It prompts the user to enter their weight on Earth. 3️⃣ The user can choose:

Option 1: Calculate their weight on Mars only.

Option 2: Calculate their weight on any planet in the dictionary. 4️⃣ The program checks if the planet name is valid and calculates the equivalent weight. 5️⃣ If an invalid choice or planet name is entered, an error message is displayed.

🛠 Key Features & Concepts Used:
✅ Dictionaries – Stores gravity multipliers for each planet.
✅ Functions – Separate functions handle Mars-only and multi-planet calculations.
✅ User Input Handling – Ensures valid input for weight and planet names.
✅ Conditional Statements – Directs program flow based on user choices.
✅ String Formatting & Rounding – Displays results in a readable format.

🪐 Gravity Factors Used in Calculation:
🌑 Mercury: 0.376x Earth weight

🟡 Venus: 0.889x Earth weight

🔴 Mars: 0.378x Earth weight

🟠 Jupiter: 2.36x Earth weight

🪐 Saturn: 1.081x Earth weight

🔵 Uranus: 0.815x Earth weight

🌊 Neptune: 1.14x Earth weight

🎯 Example Usage:
📌 User Input:
plaintext
Enter a weight on Earth: 70
Enter a planet: Mars
📌 Output:
plaintext
The equivalent weight on Mars: 26.46
