🎮 High-Low Guessing Game
This Python script implements a High-Low Guessing Game, demonstrating the use of loops, 
conditionals, and user input validation. The game consists of five rounds, where the player 
must guess whether their randomly generated number is higher or lower than the computer's.

🔹 How the Game Works:
Welcome Message & Initialization:

The game starts with a welcome message and initializes a score counter.

Gameplay Loop (5 Rounds):

In each round:

A random number between 1 and 100 is assigned to the player.

The computer also generates a random number.

The player must guess whether their number is higher or lower than the computer’s.

Guess Validation & Score Update:

The program checks if the player’s guess is correct.

The score is updated based on the player's correct guess.

End of Game:

After 5 rounds, the game ends and displays the player's final score.

A feedback message is shown based on their performance.

🛠 Key Features & Concepts Used:
✅ Random Number Generation:

Uses Python’s random.randint() to generate random numbers for both the player and the computer.

✅ Looping & Iteration:

Uses a for loop to run the game for a fixed number of rounds (5 rounds in this case).

✅ User Input & Validation:

Ensures the player enters a valid response by checking for higher or lower.

✅ Conditional Logic:

The game uses conditional statements to determine if the player's guess is correct and to update the score.

✅ Score Tracking:

Keeps track of the player's correct guesses and updates the score for each round.

🏆 Final Score Messages:
🌟 Perfect Score: "Wow! You played perfectly!"

(All guesses correct)

💡 Good Score: "Good job, you played really well!"

(At least half correct)

😅 Needs Improvement: "Better luck next time!"

(Less than half correct)

🚀 Play, practice, and improve your guessing skills!
This project is great for learning key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling. Enjoy the game and challenge yourself to guess better with each round!
