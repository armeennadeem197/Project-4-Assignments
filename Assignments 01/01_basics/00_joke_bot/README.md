# 🤖 Joke Bot – A Fun Python Script! 🎭

This program is a simple interactive **Joke Bot** that responds to user input! 😆

---

## 📌 How It Works

📝 The bot prompts the user:

> _"What do you want? If you want a joke, type 'joke': "_

- If the user types `"joke"` → it shares a funny **programmer joke**! 🤓  
- Otherwise → it replies:  
  > _"Sorry, I only tell jokes."_ 😅

## 🛠 Key Features

✔ Uses string constants for clean and readable code.  
✔ Trims extra spaces from user input using `.strip()`.  
✔ Simple and effective `if-else` condition for logic handling.  
✔ Beginner-friendly — great for learning input/output and conditionals in Python!
