🎲 Random Numbers Generator! 🔢✨
This Python script generates 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 and prints them! 🎉

📌 How It Works:
1️⃣ Uses random.randint(MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE) to generate random numbers.
2️⃣ Loops 10 times (controlled by N_NUMBERS).
3️⃣ Prints each randomly generated number.

🛠 Key Features:
✔ Uses constants (N_NUMBERS, MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE) for flexibility.
✔ Efficiently loops using a for loop with _ (indicating an unused variable).
✔ Generates truly random numbers each time the script runs.
