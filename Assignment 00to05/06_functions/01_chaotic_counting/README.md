🎲 CHAOTIC COUNTING - FUNCTION DESCRIPTION
🔢 Functionality
This program counts from 1 to 10, but there’s a twist! A random chance determines whether the counting stops early, making it unpredictable.

📝 How It Works?
chaotic_counting()

Counts from 1 to 10, but may stop randomly based on probability.
Calls the done() function to check if it should stop.
done()

Uses a 20% chance (DONE_LIKELIHOOD = 0.2) to return True, stopping the count early.
main()

Prints a message before starting the count.
Calls chaotic_counting() and displays "I'm done" at the end.
📌 Possible Output Examples
I'm going to count until 10 or until I feel like stopping, whichever comes first.  
1  
2  
3  
I'm done
