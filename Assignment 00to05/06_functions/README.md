🚀 FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON
00_averages - 📊 Calculating the Average
This program calculates the average of a set of numbers. It likely takes a list of values, sums them up, and divides by the count to return the average. Useful for computing statistics!

01_chaotic_counting - 🔢 Randomized Counting
A function that counts numbers in a chaotic or random manner. Instead of a normal sequence (1, 2, 3...), it might skip numbers, introduce delays, or shuffle the order.

02_count_even - ⚖️ Counting Even Numbers
This function counts how many even numbers exist in a given list or range. It checks each number using num % 2 == 0 and keeps track of the total count.

04_double - ✖️ Doubling a Number Until a Limit
Takes a starting number and keeps doubling it until it reaches a set limit (like 100). A great example of exponential growth in action!

05_get_name - ✍️ User Input for Name
A simple function that asks the user for their name. It may also check for proper capitalization or prevent empty input before returning a valid name.

06_is_odd - 🔄 Checking for Odd Numbers
This function determines if a number is odd. It returns True if num % 2 != 0 and False otherwise. Handy for filtering odd numbers in a dataset!

07_print_divisor - ➗ Finding Divisors of a Number
Given an input number, this function prints all its divisors by checking which values evenly divide the number (num % i == 0).

08_print_multiple - 🔢 Printing Multiples of a Number
Takes a base number and prints its multiples up to a certain limit. Useful for multiplication tables or finding common multiples!

09_sentence_generator - 📝 Generating Random Sentences
This function constructs random or structured sentences. It may use predefined lists (nouns, verbs, adjectives) to generate meaningful or funny phrases.

10_print_ones_digit - 🔟 Extracting the Last Digit
A function that prints the last digit (ones place) of a given number. It achieves this using num % 10, isolating the final digit.
