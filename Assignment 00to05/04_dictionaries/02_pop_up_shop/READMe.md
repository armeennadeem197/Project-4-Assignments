🛒 Pop-Up Shop: Fruit Purchase Calculator

A simple Python program that lets users buy fruits and calculates the total cost using dictionaries.

## 🍏 How It Works
1. **Fruit Selection**: The user is prompted to enter the quantity for each available fruit.
2. **Price Calculation**: The total cost is calculated based on predefined fruit prices.
3. **Input Validation**: Ensures only non-negative integers are accepted.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Save the script as `main.py`.
2. Run the script in your terminal with the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
Enter the quantity of each fruit when prompted. The program will calculate and display the total cost.
