🔐 Powerful Passwords: Secure Login System
A Python program that securely verifies passwords using SHA256 hashing.

🛠 How It Works
Password Hashing: The program uses SHA256 hashing to securely store passwords, ensuring that they are not stored in plain text.

Login Verification: The entered password is hashed, and the program compares it to the stored hashed password for verification.

Predefined Users: A dictionary maps email addresses to their hashed passwords, allowing users to test the login functionality.

🚀 Usage
Clone or download the project files.

Open a terminal and run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Enter the test email and password when prompted.

The system will verify if the entered password matches the stored hash.

🔑 Features
✅ Uses SHA256 hashing for enhanced security

✅ Dictionary-based storage for logins (predefined test cases)

✅ Case-sensitive password verification

✅ Simple-to-use command-line interface for testing login functionality
