 🔢 Count Numbers Assignment

A Python script that counts the occurrences of numbers entered by the user using dictionaries.

## 📝 How It Works
1. **User Input**: Enter numbers one by one.
2. **Counting**: The script uses a dictionary to count how many times each number appears.
3. **Output**: The script displays the frequency of each number in sorted order.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Save the script as `main.py`.
2. Run the script in your terminal with the following command:

   python main.py
Enter numbers one by one. When you're finished, press Enter on a blank line to stop.

The script will then show a summary of how many times each number appears.
