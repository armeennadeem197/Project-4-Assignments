# 📖 04 - Dictionaries Assignments

A collection of Python scripts demonstrating the use of dictionaries for various tasks like counting numbers, managing phonebooks, handling shop inventory, and generating secure passwords.

## 📂 Included Assignments

### 🔢 00 - Count Numbers
This script uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of numbers in a list. It is a simple way to demonstrate how to use dictionaries for tracking and counting.

### ☎️ 01 - Phonebook
This assignment implements a phonebook system where names are mapped to phone numbers. Users can add new contacts, view existing ones, and search for phone numbers.

### 🏪 02 - Pop-Up Shop
This script simulates a shop inventory system using dictionaries to track stock and prices. It lets users buy fruits and calculates the total cost based on predefined prices.

### 🔐 03 - Powerful Passwords
This assignment demonstrates password hashing and secure login systems. It uses dictionaries to store emails and their associated hashed passwords, verifying the user's password using SHA256 hashing.
