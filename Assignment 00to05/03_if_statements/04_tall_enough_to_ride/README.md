🎢 04 - Tall Enough to Ride
A Python script that checks if a user is tall enough to ride a roller coaster based on a minimum height requirement.

📝 Code Explanation
🔹 Predefined Minimum Height → 50 (arbitrary units).
🔹 User Input → Prompts the user to enter their height.
🔹 Conditional Check → Compares the entered height with the minimum required height.

✅ Tall enough? → "You're tall enough to ride!"
❌ Too short? → "You're not tall enough to ride, but maybe next year!"
🔹 Encapsulated in main() → Ensures structured execution.
🔹 if __name__ == '__main__': → Runs the script only when executed directly.
