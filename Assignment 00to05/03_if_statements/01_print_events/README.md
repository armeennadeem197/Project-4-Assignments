🖨️ 01 - Print Even Numbers

A simple Python script that prints the first 20 even numbers using a loop.

📝 Code Explanation
🔹 Loop from 0 to 19 → Runs 20 times to generate 20 even numbers.

🔹 Multiply by 2 → Ensures only even numbers are printed (e.g., 0, 2, 4, ..., 38).

🔹 print_even_numbers() function → Encapsulates the logic for structured execution and reuse.

🔹 if __name__ == "__main__": → Ensures the script runs only when executed directly (not on import).

🚀 Usage
Run the script using any Python interpreter:

python even_numbers.py

✅ Beginner-friendly and perfect for practicing loops and basic function structure in Python! 😊
