# 📅 03 - Leap Year Checker

A simple Python script to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

## 🔍 What Is a Leap Year?

A leap year is a year that:
- Is evenly divisible by 4 **and**
- **Not** divisible by 100, **unless** it is also divisible by 400

For example:
- ✅ 2020 is a leap year
- ❌ 1900 is **not** a leap year
- ✅ 2000 is a leap year

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a year.
2. The script applies leap year logic:
   - If divisible by 4 and not 100, OR divisible by 400 → leap year
   - Otherwise → not a leap year
3. A message is printed indicating the result.

## ✅ Features

- Clean and optimized logic
- Easy to understand for beginners
- Input validation ready (can be expanded)
- Structured with a `main()` function

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python leap_year_checker.py

Enter a year when prompted.

See the result!
