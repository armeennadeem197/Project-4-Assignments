## 🔍 Project Details

### 🧼 Project 01 – Add Two Numbers

- Takes two integers as input
- Adds them and prints the sum
- Includes input validation and loop for repetition

### 🐾 Project 02 – Favorite Animal

- Asks the user for their favorite animal
- Replies: *“My favorite animal is also ___!”*
- Loops with user choice to repeat

### 🌡️ Project 03 – Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter

- Converts Fahrenheit input to Celsius using:  
  `C = (F - 32) * 5.0 / 9.0`
- Input supports decimal numbers
- Styled output + option to convert again

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Project 04 – Age Riddle Solver

- Based on a logic puzzle involving five friends:
  - Anton is 21  
  - Beth is 6 years older than Anton  
  - Chen is 20 years older than Beth  
  - Drew is Chen + Anton  
  - Ethan is the same age as Chen
- Outputs name and age of each person in a clean format

### △ Project 05 – Triangle Perimeter Calculator

- Prompts user for 3 sides of a triangle
- Calculates and displays perimeter
- Includes input validation, formatted output, and loop

### ✖️ Project 06 – Square a Number

- Prompts user for a number (float or int)
- Displays the square of the number
- Styled output, loop, and input validation

## 🔁 Repeating Functionality

All projects use a loop that prompts the user:

> Would you like to try again? (yes/no)

This allows you to test the programs multiple times without restarting.

---

## ✅ Input Validation

Every program validates inputs:
- Ensures numeric input where required
- Prevents program from crashing due to bad input

---

## 🎨 Optional Styling (Terminal Colors)

You can optionally install the `termcolor` module for better terminal styling:

```bash
pip install termcolor
```
