# **Favorite Animal Program** 🐾

## **Introduction**

This Python program asks the user for their favorite animal and responds with a personalized message. The program validates user input to ensure that it only contains letters and spaces, providing feedback when invalid input is entered. It also allows the user to continue or exit after each interaction. The output is styled with colors and emojis to enhance the user experience.

## **Features**
- Asks the user for their favorite animal.
- Validates that the input contains only letters and spaces (no numbers or special characters).
- Gives feedback to the user if the input is invalid, prompting them to try again.
- After displaying the result, prompts the user to continue or exit.
- Uses colorful text output and emojis to make the interaction engaging.

## **How It Works**
1. The program greets the user and asks for their favorite animal.
2. It validates the input, ensuring that the animal name only contains letters and spaces.
3. If the input is valid, it responds with: _"My favorite animal is also [user's animal name]!"_.
4. If the input is invalid, the user is asked to re-enter a valid animal name.
5. The program asks if the user wants to continue or stop, and repeats the process accordingly.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone or download the Python file.
2. Install the `termcolor` library (if not already installed) by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install termcolor
3. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE:
python favorite_animal.py
4. Follow the on-screen prompts and enjoy the program!

## **Code Explanation**
The program uses a loop to continually ask the user for a valid animal name. It ensures that the input only contains letters and spaces using regular expressions. If the input is valid, it responds with a personalized message; otherwise, it prompts the user to try again.

## **Key Functions:**
1. is_valid_animal_name(name) – This function checks if the animal name only contains letters and optional spaces.
2. main() – The main function that controls the program flow, handles input, validation, and output.
