# 🧻 01_add_two_numbers – Improved Addition Program 🚀

Welcome to the **Add Two Numbers** Python script!  
This program allows a user to input two numbers, calculates their sum, and displays the result with a clean and colorful interface.  
It is specially improved for **error handling**, **user input validation**, and a better **user experience**. 🌟

## 📂 How It Works

### 🔹 Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Prompt user** to enter the first number.
2. Check if input is a valid number (repeats if not).
3. Repeat same for the second number.
4. Calculate the sum.
5. Display the result using colored output.
6. Ask the user if they want to run the program again.
