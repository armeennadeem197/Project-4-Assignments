# 📌 Add Many Numbers – Python Function 🧮

This repository contains a simple yet efficient Python function to sum multiple numbers from a list. Perfect for beginners learning functions, loops, and list operations in Python. 🚀

---

## 🔹 Features

✅ **Functionality** – Accepts a list of integers and returns their total sum  
✅ **Modular Design** – Uses a reusable `add_many_numbers()` function  
✅ **Example Included** – A `main()` function demonstrates how it works

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1️⃣ Define a list of numbers  
2️⃣ Call the `add_many_numbers()` function to compute the sum  
3️⃣ Print the result in a formatted output

---

## 📂 File Structure

📁 Add-Many-Numbers/ ├── main.py # Contains the sum function and example usage


---

## 🧪 Sample Code

```python
def add_many_numbers(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

def main():
    nums = [10, 20, 30, 40]
    total = add_many_numbers(nums)
    print(f"The sum is: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
