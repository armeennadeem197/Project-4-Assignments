🖌️ Erase Canvas - Python Tkinter App 🎨
This repository contains a GUI-based Eraser Canvas Application built with Tkinter. It allows users to erase a grid of cells interactively using a draggable eraser. The project demonstrates event handling, canvas manipulation, and basic animations in Python Tkinter. 🚀

📌 Project Overview
This application features a grid-based canvas, where each cell is initially filled with a blue color. Users can drag an eraser over the grid to change the color of the cells to white, simulating an erasing effect.

🔹 Features & Functionalities
🎨 Canvas with Grid Cells
The canvas is 400x400 pixels, divided into 40x40 pixel blue cells.
Each cell is stored in a dictionary for efficient access and modification.
🖱️ Mouse-controlled Eraser
A pink eraser (20x20 pixels) follows the mouse movement when the left button is clicked and dragged.
As the eraser moves over a cell, the cell changes color from blue to white.
🛠️ Event Handling with Tkinter
<B1-Motion> event is used to track mouse movement while holding the left-click.
The eraser position updates dynamically to follow the cursor.
🎯 Customizable Settings
Canvas size, grid size, eraser size, and colors can be easily modified.
The eraser color can be changed to different shades for better visibility.

📄 File Breakdown:

main.py → Contains the complete Tkinter GUI application, including canvas creation, event handling, and eraser logic.
🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ Initialize Tkinter Window

Creates a 400x400 px canvas with a blue grid using tk.Canvas().
Generates a dictionary to store cell references.
2️⃣ Draw the Grid

Loops through the canvas dimensions to draw 40x40 px squares filled with blue color.
3️⃣ Create an Eraser

A pink square (20x20 px) represents the eraser, initialized at the top-left corner.
4️⃣ Mouse Event Handling

<B1-Motion> event moves the eraser along with the cursor.
The eraser updates its coordinates dynamically based on cursor position.
5️⃣ Erasing Cells

The function checks which cells are under the eraser and changes their fill color to white.
6️⃣ Run the Application

The main function initializes the Tkinter window and starts the main loop.
▶️ How to Run the Project
🔧 Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. Tkinter is built into Python, so no additional installations are required.

🏃 Run the Application
python main.py
This will open a Tkinter window with a blue grid and a draggable eraser. 🎨

🎯 Customization Options
You can modify various settings in the main.py file:

Setting	Description	Default Value
CANVAS_WIDTH	Width of the canvas	400 px
CANVAS_HEIGHT	Height of the canvas	400 px
CELL_SIZE	Size of each grid cell	40 px
ERASER_SIZE	Size of the eraser	20 px
bg="white"	Background color of the canvas	"white"
fill="blue"	Initial color of grid cells	"blue"
fill="pink"	Eraser color	"pink"
To change grid size, update CELL_SIZE accordingly.
To change eraser size, modify ERASER_SIZE.

📌 Learning Outcomes
This project is a great way to learn:
✅ GUI programming with Tkinter 🖼️
✅ Handling mouse events in Python 🖱️
✅ Canvas drawing and animations 🎨
✅ Dictionary-based data management 🔢

📜 Future Enhancements
🚀 Add an option to change the eraser size dynamically.
🚀 Implement a "Reset Canvas" button to refill erased cells.
🚀 Introduce multiple eraser colors or brush types.

🎯 Final Thoughts
This Eraser Canvas App is a beginner-friendly Python GUI project that demonstrates event handling, interactive UI design, and drawing on a canvas using Tkinter. 🐍💡

🔗 Perfect for beginners exploring GUI development in Python! 🚀
