# 📌 Double List – Python Function 🔢

This repository features a Python function that doubles the values in a given list using **list comprehension** for clarity and performance. 🚀  
Ideal for practicing Python list operations and understanding list comprehensions. 🐍💡

---

## 🔹 Features

✅ **Functionality** – Takes a list of integers and returns a new list with each number doubled  
✅ **Optimized Approach** – Uses list comprehension for concise and efficient execution  
✅ **Example Implementation** – Includes a `main()` function for demonstration

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1️⃣ Define a list of numbers  
2️⃣ Call the `double_numbers()` function to create a new list with doubled values  
3️⃣ Print the result to verify the output

## 🧪 Sample Code

```python
def double_numbers(numbers):
    return [num * 2 for num in numbers]

def main():
    nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    doubled = double_numbers(nums)
    print(f"Doubled list: {doubled}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
