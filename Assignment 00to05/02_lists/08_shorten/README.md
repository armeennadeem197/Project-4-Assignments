📌 Shorten List - Python List Trimming Program 🚀
This script limits a list to a maximum length of 3 by removing excess elements. It demonstrates list manipulation, loops, and user input handling in Python.

📌 Project Overview
User inputs elements into a list.
If the list exceeds 3 elements, the excess elements are removed from the end.
Removed elements are printed as they are removed.
🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ User Inputs List Elements

Elements are added to a list until the user presses Enter without typing anything.
2️⃣ Check List Length

If the list has more than 3 elements, remove extras one by one from the end.
3️⃣ Print Removed Elements

Each removed element is printed to track what was discarded.
📜 Code Explanation
MAX_LENGTH = 3  # Define maximum allowed list length

def shorten(lst):
    while len(lst) > MAX_LENGTH:  # Remove elements if the list is too long
        last_elem = lst.pop()  # Remove last element
        print(last_elem)  # Print removed element

def get_lst():
    lst = []  # Initialize empty list
    elem = input("Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: ")
    while elem != "":  # Keep collecting input
        lst.append(elem)
        elem = input("Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: ")
    return lst

def main():
    lst = get_lst()  # Get user-inputted list
    shorten(lst)  # Call function to shorten the list

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
🔹 shorten(lst) - Trimming the List
Uses a while loop to check if the list length exceeds 3.
Removes elements from the end using .pop().
Prints each removed element.
🔹 get_lst() - Collecting User Input
Takes user input and stores it in a list.
Stops taking input when the user presses Enter without typing anything.
🏗️ Project Structure
📂 Project Directory:

Project-4-Assignments/Assignments 00 to 05/02_lists/08_shorten/
│── main.py  # Python script to limit list length
📄 File Breakdown:

main.py → Handles list input and trimming.
▶️ How to Run the Project
🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

🏃 Run the Application
python main.py
This will start the script, allowing user input and list shortening.

🎯 Expected Output
Example Run:

Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: apple
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: banana
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: cherry
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: mango
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: orange
Please enter an element of the list or press enter to stop: 
orange
mango
Final List (After Removing Extra Elements)
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
🛠️ Customization Options
Modification	How to Implement
Change max list length	Modify MAX_LENGTH = <new_value>
Print final list after trimming	Add print(lst) after shorten(lst)
Remove elements from the beginning instead of the end	Use lst.pop(0) instead of lst.pop()
🎯 Learning Outcomes
✅ List manipulation (adding & removing elements) 📋
✅ Using loops & conditions for input handling 🔄
✅ Understanding list size constraints 🛠️

🎯 Final Thoughts
This Shorten List Program is a great Python exercise for list handling, user input processing, and constraints implementation. 🚀🐍
