# ➗ Remainder & Quotient Calculator

A colorful and interactive Python console program that calculates the **quotient** and **remainder** from a division operation with validations and repeat functionality.

---

## 📐 Formula Used

This calculator uses two basic operations:
- **Quotient** → `dividend // divisor`
- **Remainder** → `dividend % divisor`

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Interactive **user-friendly UI** with colors using `colorama`  
✅ Input **validation** for both dividend and divisor  
✅ **Zero-division** checks with error messages  
✅ Uses **looping** to allow multiple operations  
✅ **Clear screen** after every calculation for a clean experience  
✅ Exits gracefully when user chooses to stop

---

## 🧮 Sample Run

```bash
=========================================
       ➗ Remainder & Quotient Calculator
=========================================
Let's perform some division magic! ✨

Enter the dividend (number to divide): 17
Enter the divisor (number to divide by): 4

✅ The result of 17 divided by 4 is:
Quotient: 4
Remainder: 1

Do you want to try another division? (yes/no): no

Thanks for using the Remainder & Quotient Calculator! 👋
