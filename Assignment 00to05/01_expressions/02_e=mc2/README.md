# Mass-Energy Converter 🔬⚡

This Python project allows users to convert mass (in kilograms) into energy (in joules) using **Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula:**

```
E = m * c^2
```

Where:
- `E` is energy in joules
- `m` is mass in kilograms
- `c` is the speed of light in a vacuum, approximately **299,792,458 m/s**

---

## 📌 Features
- Simple and clean user interface
- Repeats calculation using a loop until the user chooses to exit
- Handles invalid or negative inputs with user-friendly messages
- Uses functions for clarity and modularity

---

## 💻 How It Works
1. The program welcomes the user.
2. Asks for a mass input in kilograms.
3. Validates the input to ensure it's a positive number.
4. Performs the energy calculation using the formula `E = m * c^2`
5. Displays:
   - The mass entered
   - The constant value of `c`
   - The final energy in scientific notation (e.g., `8.99e+16`)
6. Prompts the user to perform another conversion or exit.

## 🧠 Example
```
==========================================
        🌟 Welcome to the Mass-Energy Converter 🌟
==========================================
Einstein's famous equation: E = m * C^2
Let's calculate how much energy is in your mass!

Enter mass in kilograms (kg): 100

---------------- Calculation ----------------
e = m * C^2
m = 100.0 kg
C = 299792458 m/s

⚡ 8.988e+18 joules of energy!
----------------------------------------------
Would you like to convert another mass? (yes/no): no

Thank you for using the Mass-Energy Converter! 🚀
