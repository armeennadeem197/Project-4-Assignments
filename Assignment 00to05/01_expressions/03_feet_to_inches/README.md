# Feet to Inches Converter

This Python project allows users to easily convert a given number of feet to inches. The program includes input validation, a loop to repeat conversions, and enhanced user experience through color styling.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensures that only valid positive numbers are entered for feet.
- **Loop Functionality**: Prompts users repeatedly to convert more values.
- **Colorful Output**: Adds color to the output for a more visually appealing and interactive user experience.
- **Simple Calculation**: Uses the conversion factor of 12 inches per foot.

## How It Works

1. The program asks the user to input the number of feet they wish to convert.
2. It calculates the equivalent inches by multiplying the feet by 12.
3. The result is displayed, and the user is asked whether they want to perform another conversion.
4. The program continues to ask until the user chooses to stop.
