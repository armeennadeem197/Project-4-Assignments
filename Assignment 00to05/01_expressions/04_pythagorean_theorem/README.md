# 🧮 Pythagorean Calculator

This Python project allows users to calculate the **hypotenuse** of a right triangle using the **Pythagorean Theorem**. It's interactive, colorful, and beginner-friendly!

## 📚 Pythagorean Theorem

In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides:

```
BC² = AB² + AC²
```

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive user input
- Validates user input to ensure only positive numbers are entered
- Uses a loop to allow multiple calculations
- Colorful terminal output using `colorama`
- Clear and informative messages

## 🛠 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- colorama

Install colorama with:
```bash
pip install colorama
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
```bash
python pythagorean_calculator.py
```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input triangle sides and get the hypotenuse!

## 💡 Example
```
Enter the length of AB: 3
Enter the length of AC: 4
BC (hypotenuse) = √(3² + 4²) = 5.00
```
