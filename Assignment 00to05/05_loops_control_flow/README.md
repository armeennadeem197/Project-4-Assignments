🔄 Loops & Control Flow Assignments
A collection of engaging Python programs that showcase how to use loops and control flow structures effectively. Perfect for reinforcing your understanding of essential programming concepts!

📜 Assignments Overview
1️⃣ Guess My Number 🎲
A fun, interactive number guessing game that uses loops and conditional statements to provide hints (higher/lower) until the user guesses correctly.

2️⃣ Fibonacci Sequence 🔢
Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit using loops. Great for practicing sequence generation and understanding iterative processes.

3️⃣ Print Even Numbers 📆
Filters and prints only the even numbers from a given range, demonstrating how to work with lists and conditional logic.

4️⃣ Wholesome Affirmation Machine 😊
An uplifting program that encourages positive thinking. The user types a pre-defined affirmation, and the program checks for correctness, reinforcing motivation!

5️⃣ Liftoff Countdown 🚀
A countdown program simulating a rocket launch, counting down from 10 to 1 with a final "Liftoff!" message, perfect for learning decrementing loops.

6️⃣ Double It Until 100 ✖️
Takes user input and keeps doubling the number until it exceeds 100. A fun way to visualize exponential growth through loops.

🚀 How to Run
Each assignment is in its own Python script. To run any of the programs, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

python filename.py
(Replace filename.py with the name of the Python script you want to run.)
