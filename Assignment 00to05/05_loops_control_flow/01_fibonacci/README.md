🔢 Fibonacci Sequence Generator

📌 Overview: This Python program generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a maximum value of 10,000. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

⚙️ How It Works:

✅ Starts with 0 and 1 as the first two numbers.

✅ Continuously adds the previous two numbers to get the next term in the sequence.

✅ Stops when a number exceeds 10,000.

🔥 Features:

🔹 Simple & Efficient – Uses variable swapping to improve performance and avoid creating unnecessary lists.

🔹 Customizable – Change the MAX_TERM_VALUE to adjust the sequence range and explore higher numbers.

🔹 Great for Learning – Ideal for understanding loops, conditional statements, and sequence logic.
