🔢 Double It Until 100!

📌 Overview:
This interactive Python program takes a number from the user and keeps doubling it until it reaches or exceeds 100. A great way to visualize exponential growth and practice control flow using while loops!

⚙️ How It Works:

✅ Prompts the user to input an integer.

✅ Uses a while loop to double the number each time.

✅ Prints the updated number after each iteration until it hits 100 or more.

🔥 Features:

🔹 Interactive & Dynamic – User-driven input makes it fun to try different starting values.

🔹 Looping Mechanism – Great for understanding while loops in action.

🔹 Simple Yet Powerful – Demonstrates exponential growth clearly and efficiently.

💡 Try it out:
Enter a small number like 2 or 5 and watch it grow step-by-step until it becomes 100 or more! 🚀
